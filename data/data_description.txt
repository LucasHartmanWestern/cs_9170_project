Main features:
timestamp
heart rate
ankle sensor 3D data (accelleration, gyroscope, etc.)
wrist sensor 3D data (accelleration, gyroscope, etc.)
chest sensor 3D data (accelleration, gyroscope, etc.)
participant data (height, weight, etc.)
activity ID (TARGET FEATURE)

Continuous/Discrete Features:
Both.
We will likely need to adjust categorical features such as male/female to be one-hot-encoded.

Size Estimate:
54 columns (features) in total.
3,850,505 rows (samples) in total.

18 different physical activities.
9 participants (1 female, 8 males)
Data timesteps are every 0.01s.

How to Bias The Dataset:
Some activities have much less data than others.
Additionally, there is only 1 female participant.
We could synthetically produce more data for a specific activity type or for female participants.
